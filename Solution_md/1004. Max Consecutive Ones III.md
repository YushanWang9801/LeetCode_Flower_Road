# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

Example 1:
>Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

## Python Code implementation
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestOnes(self, A, K):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :type K: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left = right = 0
        swap = 0
        maxseq = 0
        
        for right in range(0, len(A)):
            if A[right] == 0:
                swap += 1
            
            if swap > K:
                while left < right and A[left] != 0:
                    left += 1
                swap -= 1
                left += 1
            
            maxseq = max(maxseq, right-left+1)
            
        return maxseq
```
